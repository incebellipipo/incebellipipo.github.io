Hey you!

I'm a software developer who builds robots. I solve problems with a multidisciplinary approach and computers have been my weapon of choice for _some_ years now.
_—Not so multidisciplinary afterall._

From what I can tell, for the time being, I'll continue to work in robotics, no matter how frustrating it can be. And it can be frustrating. _—Oh gosh, it is frustrating._

If a task is done in the same exact way more than twice, that shall be automated. Let's say, a software stack has to be installed to an embedded PC that will eventually fry, I will use IT automation tools to ease the pain of such repetitive task. _—This does not apply to sourdough bread making._

Whenever I get a chance, I love collaborating with artists. _—Who wants to make an interactive work?_
