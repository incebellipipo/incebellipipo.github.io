Hey you!

I'm a software developer who builds robots. I work multidisciplinary to solve problems, and computers have been my weapon of choice for _some_ years.
_—Not so multidisciplinary afterward._

From what I can tell, as of now, I'll continue to work on the robots, no matter how frustrating it can be. It can be frustrating. _—Oh gosh, it is frustrating._

I love to use IT automation to ease the pain repetitive tasks. I love to use computers work with artists who would like to build interactive installations. I used to compose music. _—those were the days_.
